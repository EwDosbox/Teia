City in [[Asturia]] within an fallen [[Cortex Vetus]]
## Description
A lively city under an massive rotting [[Cortex Vetus]] named [[The World Tree]]. Its relatively short roots keep falling on the protective net over the cities main part. In other parts citizens just deal with constant repairs.
## Lore
Shortly after [[The World Tree]] fell this strategic position guarded from 5 of the 6 direction  was colonised and a city was builkt here. Now the [[Cortex Vetus]] is making more problems, since it has been rotting for more than 300 years and has poisoned the cities water supply.  ([[Purify The World Tree]])
