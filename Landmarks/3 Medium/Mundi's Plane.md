- #Medium
## Description
It resembles an endless, symmetrical grid of dark metal platforms, floating in a void lit by flickering energy currents. Gravity shifts subtly. Everything buzzes with restrained magical force. It is cold and sterile filled with disassembled models, mechanical horrors and other various mechanical toys.
### [[Mundi - 1]]
Tmava seda mistnost s zaprasenym svetlem, ktere mirne trepeta. Litty zelezny stul je v centru mistnoti, na nem je nekolik zeleznych tabulek
## Story
It was generated by the first version of his core. Mightiest foes are pulled here during a boss fight with [[Salvator Mundi]]. Some might even come in willingly, trying to disable him. Time moves faster here, so [[Salvator Mundi]] can evolve while they're stuck.
## Roleplay
Fights here last much longer than they seem. Even days. After [[Salvator Mundi]] is defeated here he dies for good and the [[Mundi's Plane]] crumbles and teleports the rest on a random place.
