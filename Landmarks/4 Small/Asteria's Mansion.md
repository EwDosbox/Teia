## Description
From the road it looks like its just an endless garden, but to those that are lucky enough can see through those thick bushes and find a rather sizeable 2 storied mansion with a tower nearby.
The gardens are full of roses, shaped to resemble dogs and snakes. Instead of the fountain that is traditionally placed near the mansion entrance there is a large brass cauldron that seems to be used sporadically.
The mansion itself seems to keep itself fully stocked, cleaned up and prepared.
