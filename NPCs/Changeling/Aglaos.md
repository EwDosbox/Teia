## Story
She is an 8th level Void Kineticist.
Her mother was a powerful witch, named [[Asteria]]. She never knew her sister [[Norlan]], cuz she is much older than her. She has also never met [[Asteria]].
## Lore
She resides in [[Aglaos'es Hut]] on the [[Ethereal Plane]], but when the [[Void]], her source of power, fluctuates she is often seen down in the [[Material Plane]] near 3-way crossroads.
When travelers dont come inside and talk with her, she involuntrily puts them in a movement loop where they will end up on the same crossroad. She isnt aware of this phenomenon.
## Relations
- [[Asteria]] is her mother, thus [[Norlan]] is her sister
## Description
A very tall albino woman, with pure white skin and hair. Her albino condition contrast with her choice of fashion, as she most often wears rather dark and grim clothes with lots of available movement as she enjoys a good fight. When being outside she prefers dark and shade. She never leaves her hut without [[Aglaos'es Hat]].
It seems that her secluded lifestyle doesnt impact her form at all. Throughout all the folds of her mystical attire you can still tell that she is a mighty melle oponent and to be feared.
## Roleplay
Kind, but intimidating. Vzbuzuje respekt.
## Notes
- Name is an alternative of the goddess Hecate
