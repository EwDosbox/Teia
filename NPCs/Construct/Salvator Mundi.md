The v.1.3 mean its CR 3.
## Roleplay
Every time he dies his core absorbs near magical energy and travels to [[Mundi's Plane]], where he builds a new model each time. 
He quickly changes aggro in combat to the strongest one in the fight.
## Lore
He was build by [[Diploria Sclera]] in [[Diploria's Inventions]] who embedded her own consciousness into his first model. [[Salvator Mundi]] killed him minutes after activation, absorbing his knowledge like it was a default behavior
