## Description
A mysterious tall and lanky figure.
He's dressed in full black and white. He has a long black suit on with a white undershirt. His shoulders are adored with a lace cape. He has black, always freshly cleaned, boots with a curved tip inwards. His face is covered by a hat and a silver mask.
## Story
He studied at the [[Agarve Uni]] with [[Oriundus]] wizardry, but he was kicked out after only one semster for not studying and partying too hard as he says.
After getting kicked out off [[Agarve Uni]] he opened his [[Chester's Legal Shop]], where he sells and buys magical items and other various knick-knacks 
He met [[Oriundus]] again once when he was out to drink and had a duel with him. However since he was drunk he made a wild magic surge and almost killed [[Oriundus]]. That's why he has a vendetta against him, whilst Chester doesn't even remember it.
