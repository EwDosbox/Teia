- [[LG]], #NPC
## Description
[[Magical Beast]] of **animated white sand**. They are kind of *Incorporeal*, all attacks phase through him and scratch up the weapon.
Inside his ever-changing form is a bleak orange light, his core.
## Lore
They are nor a construct nor a summoned creature, but a natural consequence of the [[Tabernas]]'s ancient magic and lingering grief.
Protects [[Tahal]] with his life.
## Roleplay
Must be talked through or completely obliterated (Fireball?). 
They cannot speak. Instead, they engage the intruders **within their minds**, whispering thoughts, emotions, and questions directly into their psyche. They fights like a **mesmerist**, using illusions, mental suggestion, and subtle control.
