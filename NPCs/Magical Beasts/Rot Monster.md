## Description
A [[Fey]]-touched [[Magical Beast]]. Its eye-less face that's mainly one massive maw full of stone teeth stroke fear in many brave beings that dared to enter the [[Tree Catacombs]]. On the top of its unnaturally big head is a pair of flowering trees. Each part of its enormous body is adored with flowers and grasses of many types. The main blossom on the back is still closed.
It seems like this monster is an amalgamation of many many common forest plants and trees, surrounding the fallen [[The World Tree]].
## Lore
Attempt of [[The World Tree]] to  end its tragic miserable decay. It has all the power of the [[Cortex Vetus]].
