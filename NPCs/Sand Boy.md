- [[LG]]
## Description
[[Magical Beast]] of **animated white sand**. He is *Incorporeal*, all attacks phase through him and scratch up the weapon.
Inside his ever-changing form is a bleak orange light, his core.
## Lore
He is nor a construct nor a summoned creature, but a natural consequence of the desert's ancient magic and lingering grief.
Protects [[Sand Place]] with his life.
## Roleplay
Must be talked through or completely obliterated (Fireball?). 
He cannot speak. Instead, he engages intruders **within their minds**, whispering thoughts, emotions, and questions directly into their psyche. He fights like a **mesmerist**, using illusions, mental suggestion, and subtle control.
